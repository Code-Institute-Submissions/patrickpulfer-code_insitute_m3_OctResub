## Deployment

### Demo

- End User live demo available at https://the-interview-master-deck.herokuapp.com/
- Admin Portal live demo available at https://the-interview-master-deck.herokuapp.com/admin (username: admin@admin.com, password: SuperSecret123!)

### Requirements

- A host capable to run python3 applications and PIP3, with internet access
  - Example: https://www.heroku.com/
- A host capable to run MongoDB with internet access
  - Example: https://www.mongodb.com/

### Steps

- Database Server (Steps for MongoDB.com but consult with your host/provider for proper documentation)
  1. [Create a database cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/)
  2. [Create a user for your cluster](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-mongodb-user-for-cluster/)
     1. navigate to **Database Access** under _Security_ menu
     2. SCRAM username and password should only be **alphanumeric** _(no special characters!)_
     3. select **Read and Write to any Database** from _Database User Privileges_
  3. Whitelist your IP
     1. navigate to **Network Access** under _Security_ menu
     2. select **Allow Access From Anywhere**
     3. _supply IP Addresses of actual hosts further security_
  4. [Create a database called 'TheInterviewMasterDeck', together with your first collection called 'admin'](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/insert-data-into-your-cluster/)
     1. - select **Add My Own Data** from the _Collections_ tab on your Cluster Sandbox
  5. Navigate back to your cluster and click on 'connect' then 'connect your application'
  6. Ensure Python is selected as your driver with version 3.6
  7. Note your connection string, you will require to set this up in your environment variables at the App Server. <img src="./documentation/pictures/mongo1.png">
- Application Server (Steps for Heroku.com but consult with your host/provider for proper documentation)
  1. [Review official documentation for steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
  2. Add the necessary environment variables to Heroku
     1. Go to Heroku Settings Tab
     2. Click Reveal Config Vars
     3. Add the following: MONGO_URI = <Mongo URI, which you have noted earlier in MongoDB>
     4. Add a new variable: SECRET_KEY = <create your own key, for testing secret-key is enough>
     - Example: <img src="./documentation/pictures/heroku1.png">
  3. Deploy the App directly from this github or a fork:
     1. Go to the Deploy Tab
     2. Click GitHub for Deployment Method
     3. Click Connect to GitHub
     4. Provide your GitHub repository name, then click Search (example: https://github.com/patrickpulfer/code_insitute_m3)
     5. Click Deploy Branch on Heroku
  4. Run the initial setup app: `python3 initial_setup.py` and create your admin credentials
- Local Installation (assuming your have python3 and pip3 installed on your machine; if not, install it now!)
  1. You may deploy the repo locally. The follow instructions below are for a linux machine
  2. Create a folder where you want the App to reside and navigate to it in your command line
  3. Clone the App from Github:
  ```bash
  git init
  git clone https://github.com/patrickpulfer/code_insitute_m3.git .
  ```
  4. Create an environment variable file called env.py and add the following:
  ```python
  import os
  os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "<your_secret_key_here>")
  os.environ.setdefault(
    "MONGO_URI", "<YOUR MONGO DB URI YOU HAVE NOTED EARLIER>")
  ```
  5. Install dependencies with PIP3:
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  6. Run the initial setup app and create your admin credentials:
  ```bash
  python3 initial_setup.py
  ```
  7. Run the App
